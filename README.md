# DevOpsHomework
An initial starting repository for Homework by folks interviewing for DevOps positions at Datical

Do not clone this repository directly! Anyone doing homework should first fork this repository and use that as the source.

Instructions for doing the homework are located [in the Datical Confluence system](https://datical.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DVOP/pages/474678275/DevOps+Interview+Homework).
